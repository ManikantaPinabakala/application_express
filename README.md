# application_express

<b> This simple web application has two of the many functionalities that I learned to program from the NodeJS workshop:</b> <br>
<ul>
  <li> Simple percentage calculator for marks achieved in a subject </li>
  <li> MySQL Database connection to the web application </li>
</ul>

The whole application is based on the `EJS template engine`.
